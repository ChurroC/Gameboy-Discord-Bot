This is a simple way to start to build a discord bot. All you have to do is just add commands and Slash Commands to the appropriate folders . Also remeber to add BOT_TOKEN, GUILD_ID, and CLIENT_ID. Run npm deploy to deploy to deploy the slash commands to the server.

Still have to add embeds.
Have to add comments.
